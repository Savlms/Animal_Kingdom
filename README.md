OOP paradigms were used to model this simple class to avoid repetition of code and to produce a well-structured and scalable code.

They include:


1. Inheritance
An animal Parent class was created which all the classes inherited from to avoid re-implementing the same functionality, to make the code simplified making it easier to make changes to the code, and it allowed me to make use of another OOP paradign 'Polymorphism'.

2. Abstraction
Abstract methods were used in the neccessary places to prevent misuse of some classes.

3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism was used to enforce method overriding in to classes that had different but similar methods.

4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation was used to improve code security by making some methods and properties of an object private.
